         <div id="hobbiesinfo"><p>For my hobbies I like to do soccer or football, I like to do math, I like to swim, I like to play table tennis or ping pong, and I like to do BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu). For soccer I played soccer since I was a kid and I joined a team in 2022, for math I really enjoy doing it and I am smart at it, for swimming I only do it for fun and I learned how to swim since I was a kid, and for BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) I joined a BJJ gym last year.</p></div>
